# Big O Reference: [bigoref.com](http://bigoref.com)
Big O Reference is a static site that summarizes the complexities of common algorithms and data structures.

## Motivation
If you know this project you probably know [BigOCheatSheet](https://github.com/ericdrowell/BigOCheatSheet) too. The problem is it doesn't include the whole source for the site and many contributions can't be done (like adding CSS for printing). Besides that, it hasn't been very active in the last year despite the fact that has 31 open PRs.

Of course all my content here come from that site or Wikipedia. Sometimes these complexities are open to debate because depend on how the algorithm is implemented.

# Features
* 100% Open source
* Friendly printable version

## Contributions
If you want to contribute please create an issue or a PR and I'll try to reply soon. The project is just static HTML/CSS/JS so everyone can just download the files and start modifying them.

## Credits
All credits should go to [Eric Drowell](https://github.com/ericdrowell) for [BigOCheatSheet](https://github.com/ericdrowell/BigOCheatSheet) and all the contributors that helped him.

This is just an attempt to keep that project alive and hopefully improve it.
